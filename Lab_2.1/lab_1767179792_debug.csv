1,?,?,,,,,Program execution starts.
2,3,?,FALSE,,,"scanf(""%d"", &N) reads 3. scanf returns 1. Condition (1 != 1) is FALSE."
3,3,0,FALSE,"1st (i=0)",Hello Loop!,N <= 0 (3 <= 0) is FALSE. Enters 'else' block. Prints ""Hello Loop!"". i becomes 1."
4,3,1,FALSE,"2nd (i=1)",Hello Loop!,i < N (1 < 3) is TRUE. Prints ""Hello Loop!"". i becomes 2."
5,3,2,FALSE,"3rd (i=2)",Hello Loop!,i < N (2 < 3) is TRUE. Prints ""Hello Loop!"". i becomes 3."
6,3,3,FALSE,"Loop End (i=3)",,i < N (3 < 3) is FALSE. Loop terminates.
7,3,3,,,,,Program ends with return 0.
